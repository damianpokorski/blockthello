# Blockthellow

Just a simple othello clone written in JavaScript, since I've felt like I've not made any games recently.

It's very simple but I've used it as a practice playground for ES6 standards.

It's written using:
- p5.js - Rendering library
- Browserify & Babel - for compiling
- Moderninzr - Just for base html template since I've felt really lazy
